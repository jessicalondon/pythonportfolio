# My Python Data Science Portfolio

Hello! I'm Jessica, a transitioning professional from the finance sector. This portfolio serves as a collection of some of the projects I've completed during my Data Science Bootcamp at HyperionDev.

## Projects

### 1. Task Manager (`task_manager.py`)

This project is a Python-based task management system. 

It is designed to keep track of tasks and manage user registration. The program uses several functions to register users, add new tasks, view all tasks, and view tasks assigned to a particular user.

### 2. Inventory Management System (`inventory_final.py`)

I developed an inventory management system in Python that reads from a text file and performs various operations on the data. 

This system is built around the Shoes class using OOP with several attributes and methods. 

It also allows users to capture data about a shoe, view all data, restock, search for a shoe, calculate the total value for each item, and determine the product with the highest quantity.

### 3. Titanic Dataset EDA (`titanic.ipynb`)

In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. 

I used various data analysis techniques to uncover the underlying patterns, correlations, and insights from the data.
